**PROMELA**: Process meta-language, language for modelling concurrent systems.  
Small language - only intended for modelling!

### First programs
```promela
active proctype P() {
    int val = 123;
    short hi;
    hi = val % 10;
    printf("Hello World\nhi = %d\n", hi)
}
```

- Data types: `bit bool byte short int unsigned` (no floats)
- No strings outside print literals
- Any declaration of `active proctype` spawns individual process; concurrent
- `active [2] proctype` spawns 2 processes running the same code

### Enums
```promela
mtype = { red, yellow, green };
mtype light = green;
```

- At most 1 per program called `mtype`; max 255 enumerations

### Control Flow
```promela
if
    :: 34 > 3 -> printf("a"); a = 4
    :: 34 < 3 -> printf("b"); b = 2
    :: else -> printf("oops")
fi

do
    :: 34 > 3 -> printf("a"); a = 4
    :: 34 < 3 -> printf("b"); b = 2
    :: else -> break
od

int i;
int sum = 0;
for (i : 1 .. 10) {
    sum = sum + i
}

goto ack
printf("no")
ack:
printf("why")
```

- If multiple cases true: *random* selection
- If none true: Process blocks until one is true

### Arrays
```promela
byte a[132];
a[12] = 12;
for (i in a) { ... }
```

- Initialized to 0 on all elements
- 0-indexed, bounded, only 1-dimensional

### Records
```promela
typedef DATE {
    byte day, month, year;
}

DATE d;
d.day = 1; 
d.year = 2021;
```

Cannot be self-referential.

### Inline
Procedure calls do not exist; `inline name(params)` must be used for macro-like
inlining of code. This fully inlines - including scope!!


## Determinism
- PROMELA not very useful for deterministic programs
- Useful for non-determinism; mainly from scheduling or overlapping control
  flow guards

### State
- State of a process: PC and all variables
- State of a program then: Interleaving of all possible process states
- Since process always finite; program also always finite
- All computations *except* guard statements are atomic


## Usage
- Modelling of essential features of a system
- Selecting of properties the system must satisfy
- Verify that all properties are true in all possible runs/execution orders
