# 8. Parallel Performance
Primary metrics:

- Response/Execution time
- Throughput
- Energy to solution
- Performance: `1 / Resources to solution`

"Peak performance" is performance a computer cannot exceed.
Actual performance is limited by a critical resource depending on workload.


### Scalability
Weak scaling: Ability to solve larger input with more resources;
problem size per resource used stays constant

Strong scaling: Ability to solve same input faster with more resources;
usually more challenging and impacted harder by communication overhead

### Asymptotic complexity
3 different symbols:

- Big O (upper bound)
- Big Omega $\Omega$ (lower bound)
- Big Theta $\Theta$ (both bounds)

### Little's formula
$C = R \times L$

- Desired throughput $R$ items per time unit
- Latency $L$ per item
- Number $C$ of items concurrently in the system
