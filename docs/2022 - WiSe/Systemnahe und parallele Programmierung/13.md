# Performance Analysis
Performance: Resources required to solution (hardware, time, energy)

## Goals of Analysis
- Compare alternatives
- Determine feature impact
- System tuning / parameter tuning
- Identify relative performance of algorithms
- Debug performance / find bottlenecks
- Set expectations


## Methods
### Analytical modeling
- Mathematical description of system
- Often limited accuracy
- Insight into fundamental properties

### Simulation
- Program modelling important features
- Easily modified to study
- Not perfectly accurate

### Measurement
- Highest accuracy, credible
- Information restricted to system measured
- Difficult / time consuming


## Metrics
### Measured
- Count of events occurring
- Duration of an event
- Size of a parameter, e.g. bytes transferred

### Performance metrics
- Execution / response time
- Throughput
- Clock rate / IPS / FLOPS
- Benchmarks

### Non-determinism
- Modern systems often too complex to be deterministic
- Variance must be considered when measuring
- Multiple measurements, mean with deviation


## Instrumentation
- Measuring of code metrics
- Direct Instrumentation: Insertion of instrumentation code at certain points
- Sampling: Measurement performed at intervals
- Call-path profiling
- Event tracing

### Issues
- Accuracy: Measurement can change runtime behavior and skew results
- Granularity: How many measurements?
- Hardware counters can alleviate this
