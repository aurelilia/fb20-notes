# 5. Processes & Threads
Timesharing (multitasking) often used, even on multi-CPU systems


## Processes
A program in execution.

### States
- *new*: Process just spawned
- *ready*: Ready for scheduling
- *running*: Currently being executed
- *waiting*: Waiting on a system resource
- *terminated*: Program exited

### Memory representation
- Usually: Stack growing down, heap growing up
- Program code and global variables/data in bottom of address space

### Threads
- Basic unit of execution
- Usually includes ID, PC, register set and stack
- Shares resources with other threads in same process
- Concurrency through shared resources in same process
  (instead of IPC or network with multiple processes)
  - More convinient, communication implicit
  - Address space between threads not protected
  - Harder to scale than IPC
  - More space efficient, less replication
  - Easier to debug


## Multithreading
### On-chip (SMT)
- Big problem with modern CPUs: Stalls cause the CPU to effectively
  end up doing nothing while waiting
- SMT allows CPU to mask stalls by executing different thread
- Usually 2-4 threads per-core
- Intel's hyperthreading:
  - Enables true concurrency within a core
  - May lead to resource contention due to sharing between threads

### Fine- vs coarse-grained
- Fine-grained: threads running round-robin, rescheduling at regular
  intervals
- Course-grained: reschedule only upon stall / waiting on resources

### Ways of improving CPU perf
- Increase clock speed
- Put more cores into one package
- Add functional units
- Make pipeline longer
- Use SMT
