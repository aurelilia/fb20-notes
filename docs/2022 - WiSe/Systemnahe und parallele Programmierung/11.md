# 11. Parallel Patterns
## Design spaces for parallel programs
Design considerations for parallel programs, in descending abstraction level:
### Finding concurrency
... finding concurrency exposed by the problem

- Decomposition: either into tasks or chunks of data
- Analysis of dependencies between tasks and data

### Algorithm structure
... taking advantage of the problem's concurrency

- Organization by task, data or flow of data; each either linear or recursive
- "Divide and conquer": Keep dividing problem into subproblems
  (task/recursive organization)
- Pipeline: flow of data/linear organization

### Supporting structures
... libraries, shared data structures

- Program structure (SPMD, task pooling, etc.)
- Data structure (shared/local/distributed, synchronization, etc.)

### Implementation mechanisms
... programming languages, low-level mechanisms, etc.
